# 🚀 Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) in Java

Welcome to my **DSA & Advanced Java Learning Repository** 👨‍💻  
This repo contains all the Java programs and concepts I’ve been practicing — starting from **Core Java and DSA** to **Advanced Java** topics like **JDBC**, **Hibernate**, **Servlets**, and **Spring Boot**.

---

## 📘 Overview

This repository is a collection of my learning journey through:
- ✅ Core Java & DSA fundamentals  
- ⚙️ Object-Oriented Programming concepts  
- 📊 Data Structures & Algorithms (Arrays, LinkedLists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, etc.)  
- 🧩 Problem-solving and optimization  
- 💻 Advanced Java technologies and backend frameworks  

---

## 🧩 Contents

### 🧠 DSA in Java
Implementation-based learning of fundamental and advanced data structures and algorithms:
- Searching and Sorting Algorithms  
- Recursion and Backtracking  
- Stack, Queue, Linked List  
- Tree and Graph problems  
- Dynamic Programming  
- Common interview-based problems  

All programs are written in **pure Java**, with focus on **clarity**, **time complexity**, and **interview-oriented logic**.

---

### ☕ Advanced Java (Coming Soon)
After DSA, I’ll be adding hands-on projects and examples using:

- **JDBC** — Database connectivity and CRUD operations  
- **Hibernate** — ORM concepts and real-world mappings  
- **Servlets & JSP** — Web-based Java application fundamentals  
- **Spring Boot** — Modern backend application development with REST APIs, JPA, and microservices
